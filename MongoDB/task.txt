1) Create DB

2) Design: Create a Blog DB with instances (author/articles/comments(+author)/tags). Try to practice CRUD operation. (create sh/bash/bat/etc file for running commands)

3) Make your DB as faster as need but not more. Create a dump of DB and put list of commands in separate system file for running.

4) There are documents for each student (student_id) across a variety of classes (class_id). Your task is to calculate the class with the best average student performance. This involves calculating an average for each student in each class of all non-quiz assessments and then averaging those numbers to get a class average.
